The API server for the ET service including ET1 and ET3

## Introduction

This application is to replace the current JADU system as of March 2018

## API Documentation

API documentation is provided semi automatically using a rake task.  This comes from the
'Rspec API Documentation' gem (https://github.com/zipmark/rspec_api_documentation) which
allows us to define special documentation specs which provide the example data and the
response is recorded and documented for us.

At the moment, we can just use this as it comes out but in the future, it may well be used
as an input to the documentation process if we need more control.

To generate new documentation after you have modified the API in any way, please run

```
rake docs:build
```


and then look in the docs/api folder - you will see open_api.json which is for use with swagger.
You can copy and paste this directly into swaggerhub or use a swagger UI (which hopefully, we will get built
into this app one raday so it can be viewed in dev environments)

But, we also have markdown documents which you can just read, see

[docs/api/index.md]

Note: Do not use the rake docs:generate that the gem tells you to - as that will expect things in the wrong place.

## Design

See [this page](docs/design.md)

## Manual Testing

See [this page](docs/manual_testing.md)

## External Dependencies

Unless you are using docker, then you must make sure you have the following dependencies met

### zip and unzip

These are used to produce and test the zip files during exporting of claims

### pdftk

Used to produce PDF's

Note: At the time of writing, this is hanging under OSX - If you are having this issue, please install this version which works

https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/pdftk_server-2.02-mac_osx-10.11-setup.pkg

### mcrypt

Used to decrypt messages from acas

### postgres

Both server, client and nescessary headers for development

### redis

Used for background jobs - not entirely nescessary depending on what you are working on

### minio

We use amazon S3 wired up to active storage, which you would normally use a test adapter for, however we also have
some code that copies from one S3 bucket to another which cannot use active storage - so instead, we just use an S3
server (I chose minio as it has been the most reliable and most feature rich).  See its github page for more
details (https://github.com/minio/minio) - you can install it on OSX and linux - or you can use docker (note that it
is integrated into ./bin/dev/docker-support-services

## Developing And Testing Using Docker

### Initial Setup (Run once)

```
    ./bin/dev/docker ./bin/setup
```

### Running a server

```

./bin/dev/docker-server up

```


which will run a server on a randomly assigned port which is great if you don't want to do
port forwarding (e.g. running automated tests doesnt rely on it - its just for traditional
manual browser based testing).

If you want to find out what this port is, just use 

```

docker ps

```

and look for something like this

```

CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED                  STATUS                  PORTS                     NAMES
ffefd71a2b99        dev_dev             "irb"                    Less than a second ago   Up Less than a second   0.0.0.0:32770->8080/tcp   dev_dev_1
c8bd276535aa        postgres:9.3.5      "/docker-entrypoint.…"   Less than a second ago   Up 1 second             0.0.0.0:32769->5432/tcp   dev_db_1
854adc82aba2        redis               "docker-entrypoint.s…"   3 minutes ago            Up 3 minutes            0.0.0.0:32768->6379/tcp   dev_redis_1


```

where it can be seen that the 'dev' process is forwarding port 32770 to
port 8080 in the docker container, allowing you to go to http://localhost:32770 on your 
machine (depending if you need to setup yet another port forward if you are using a version
of docker that doesnt forward straight to your localhost)

or if you want to specify the port - lets say you just want it on port 3000 and have ensured
that it is available - else it wont start.

```

PORT=3200 ./bin/dev/docker-server

```

which will run a server on port 3200


### Killing The Server

Sometimes you need to do this - if CTRL-C seems to stop really quickly !!

```

./bin/dev/docker-server down

```

### Running commands on the docker box

If you want to connect to the same machine to run other commands whilst the server is running :-


```

./bin/dev/docker-exec bash

```

which will give you a bash session

or you can run other commands - for example

```

./bin/dev/docker-exec bundle exec rails c

```


will give you a rails console



### Running support services only

Often, you may want to run the rails server yourself and just have docker bring up 
any supporting services such as the database.

Simply do :-

```

./bin/dev/docker-support-services up

```

which will bring up the database on a random port and a redis server on a random port unless changed by the environment vars.

to kill them (assuming CTRL-C didn't do it)

```

./bin/dev/docker-support-services down

```


As stated above in the 'Running a server section' - you can use 

```

docker ps

```

to find out which ports are being forwarded where.

or if you just want to use a fixed port - then do this :-

```

DB_PORT=5450 ./bin/dev/docker-support-services

```

and use the same DB_PORT when you run your server - so for example with 'rails s' do :-


```

DB_PORT=5450 bundle exec rails s

```

similar with the redis port - but change REDIS_PORT instead - for example

```

REDIS_PORT=6380 ./bin/dev/docker-support-services

```

and use the same port when running the rails server or sidekiq as follows

```

REDIS_PORT=6380 bundle exec rails s

```

and

```

REDIS_PORT=6380 bundle exec sidekiq

```

and the database.yml is configured to read this, therefore the app will use this port instead of the default which is 5432


# Developing And Testing Without Docker

This is just a rails app, so if you want to manage the dependencies etc.. yourself and
setup your own database etc.. Just go about things in the normal way, but remembering these pointers

1. The database.yml uses environment variables so it can be checked into the repository.
   But, these also have defaults so if you have a database running on the standard port on localhost and
   has a user of 'postgres' then you will be good to go.  Otherwise set the environment variables below as you 
   see fit
   DB_HOST
   DB_USERNAME
   DB_PASSWORD
   DB_PORT
   DB_NAME

2. The redis config can be configured using the following to be consistent with
   the database config and also to allow just the port to be overriden (useful for local development)
   REDIS_HOST (defaults to localhost)
   REDIS_PORT (defaults to 6379)
   REDIS_DATABASE (defaults to 1)
   
   You can change any of these individually or you can ignore these by setting the full
   REDIS_URL in the traditional way - such as :-
   
   ```
   
   REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/12
   
   ```
   
## With Foreman

Whilst foreman could not be bundled in due to its version of 'thor' being too old at the time
of writing, if you install the foreman gem then you can start all required services for
a production like system using a single command :-

```

foreman start

```
   
If you are doing things manually, remember you may need sidekiq running depending
on what area of the system you are using.   

# Other Environment Variables

## EXPORT_CLAIMS_EVERY

The claims are batched up and zipped ready for consumption by the ATOS API every 15 minutes

If you want to change this during development, set this environment variable - e.g.

```

EXPORT_CLAIMS_EVERY=5

```


will set it to every 5 minutes

## S3_DIRECT_UPLOAD_BUCKET

In contrast to S3_UPLOAD_BUCKET which is for storing active storage objects, this environment variable points to
a bucket where mthe direct upload feature can be used in a front end application using the API.

# Development Guidelines

The team uses a BDD / TDD approach so it is expected for the specs to be written before the implementation as required.
The use of BDD / TDD should provide us with good test coverage, so a code coverage tool will be used to keep an eye on this.

# API Versioning

## V1 - The Old JADU API

As we need to get the project off the ground very quickly, the V1 API will look and feel
just like the original JADU API - so there are no changes to the ET1 application.

However, this API is very clunky in that it uses XML as part of a multi part form which also sends the files as well.
This can now be done much better using a simple REST interface with base64 encoding of the files as just normal data.

## V2 - The New API For ET3 - and eventually ET1

Version 2 will be written from the ground up for ET3 to begin with, but the long term goal is for ET1 to move over to it so we can remove all of the XML code from ET1 app and just send the data over this RESTful interface.

## The Test Suite

### Database cleaning

In general, it is thought that each test example does not need a perfectly clean database, so at least for now, the database will be partially cleaned when the example
specifies db_clean: true in the example metadata.

A lot of time can get wasted cleaning the database when not required, so it is up to the developer to either write their tests in a way that
does not need a perfectly clean database OR specify that it should be cleaned first using db_clean: true

For example :-

```

RSpec.describe 'Some feature', type: :request do
  it 'should do something with a clean DB to start with', db_clean: true do
    <<code>>
  end
end

```

Note that the strategy at the moment is to clean before a marked example using 'truncation' as opposed to using transactions.

This is because transactions modify the behavior of rails when using postgres. The high level transaction is done one way and the rest are done another - so adding a transaction at the start makes things behave differently.
Also, transactions cannot be used when testing over a real http connection as opposed to rack-test which we may well do.

If on the other hand, we decide the suite is too slow, this may well get changed - but it is much easier to change from truncation to transaction
than the other way around.

### Database test data

Seed data is setup for use in both development and test - containing what is considered to be static data such as offices etc..

### Direct Database Access

There is no admin interface or any way that a 'user' (a user in this case is an API client) can validate that things have been persisted for later use.

Whilst there is an admin project that will connect to the same database as this application, this will not be used during the automated testing of this application.

Instead, we will be going for the direct database approach where the ruby test code can access the same database as the application under test.

# Administering The Database

This application has a partner admin application (https://github.com/ministryofjustice/et-admin) which needs to be setup to share the same database.

The admin is kept separate for scaling purposes as we expect more API users than admin users by a significant factor.

If you just want to do this and nothing else during development and are OK working with ruby - just clone it, set the DB_HOST, DB_NAME, DB_PORT and DB_USERNAME env vars
to point to the same DB as this application and go for it.

If you want to run an entire system including the admin but are not interested in using ruby - i.e. you are testing or just viewing this application, you may want to consider it's "umbrella" project (https://github.com/ministryofjustice/et-full-system)
which used docker-compose to bring all of the components together and allows you to run them much easier.
